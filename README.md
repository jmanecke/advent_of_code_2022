# advent_of_code_2022
my 2022 [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) work

I like solving the puzzles and trying out different approaches. All python so far and will probably stay that way. Not going for most elegant, fastest solution, or anything like that.

###Notes along the way
#### Day 6
Looking back on what's done so far, I've started to develop a point of view for this year. Generally, I'm writing code that's flexible and easy to understand. As I'm working on my solutions, I find myself asking "If someone looked at this two years from now and had to modfiy it, how easy or hard would that be." As a result, it's definitely not the most compact code. The code is also not super efficient - though I'm trying to not be aggregiously wasteful of computer stuff.

It's fun reading through the [Adent of Code Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) each day. I found links to some extra large inputs for the Day 5 crate stacking problem. Trying those clearly showed that my python was not super-optimized. Sure my code could plow through crates stacked 8 high, but trying to work with stacks nearly 1.5 million crates high was another matter.
